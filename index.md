### Fraud Detection based on the specifications of the payments 

The goal of fraud detection is to identify patterns or anomalies in the data that may indicate fraudulent behavior. This can involve analyzing a range of data sources, such as financial transactions, user behavior, device data, and other contextual information. In this project, I tried to find fraudulent transactions based on the transaction amounts and different customer behaviours using XGBoost Classifier along with fine-tuning algorithm BayesSearch.
