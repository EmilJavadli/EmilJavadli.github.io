### Fraud Detection based on the specifications of the payments 

The goal of fraud detection is to identify patterns or anomalies in the data that may indicate fraudulent behavior. In this project, I tried to find fraudulent transactions based on the transaction amounts and different customer behaviours using XGBoost Classifier along with fine-tuning algorithm BayesSearch.

### Loan approval of customers who applied for a loan based on the specifications of applicants 

The loan approval process involves a series of steps and criteria used by a lender or financial institution to assess whether to approve or deny a loan application. In this particular project, various classification algorithms were implemented, and the performance of each algorithm was evaluated to determine which one provided the best results.
