### Fraud Detection based on the specifications of the payments 

The objective of fraud detection is to detect any irregular patterns or anomalies within the data that could potentially indicate fraudulent activity. In this project, the focus was on identifying fraudulent transactions by analyzing the transaction amounts and various customer behaviors. To achieve this, an XGBoost Classifier was utilized in conjunction with the fine-tuning algorithm BayesSearch.

### Loan approval of customers who applied for a loan based on the specifications of applicants 

The loan approval process involves a series of steps and criteria used by a lender or financial institution to assess whether to approve or deny a loan application. In this particular project, various classification algorithms were implemented, and the performance of each algorithm was evaluated to determine which one provided the best results.
